I am so thankful that he took the role !
Awww while I was listening to this I started imagining Walter White as a married woman in late 40s, a school teacher diagnosed with cancer, with two midschool twin daughters and a second husband, what an interesting and impossible story it would be
Huh they changed the script from walter being forty in this to fifty in the show
#woke
hated the character...walter was the man!
who didnt love this show it was amazing.. true detective also was the bomb tits diggity
This guys terrible, I hope they don't cast him
Damn... he forgot his line and still got the part. That shows how incredible his acting was in that minute or so.
Wonderful!
WW is 41?!
Yeeeaaahhhh bitch!!
Legendary
So... did he get the role?
He sounds a bit like Todd from Bojack Horseman
This is oddly bad imo
Sawyer
I love breaking bad....
Crazy to think that Walter was originally going to be 41. It makes me wonder if his age was changed due to Bryan Cranston's appearance, or if it just happened to fit the plot better.
Dude is perfect for that role and clearly a boss
CAROOOL!
Never really liked his character, except for season 3, in which he was sober and not doing stupid things, but he surely played a great junkie!
Bitch
Who is this dick? Never heard of him.
So when Aaron auditioned for this, obviously Bryan Cranston had NOT been chosen yet.  Walt is 41 in this screen test, but this scence in the TV show, Walt is 51.  So Vince Gillingham changed the character from 41 to 51.
:40  he totally blows his lines.
nailed it
He's really good. I hope they pick him.
A genius at work.
Lucky he was cast in the role based on this audition. And they’re lucky someone saw something in him. His acting in the real version of this scene is 100x better.
Crazy thinking that they were gonna kill off Aaron in the first season
Show wouldn't have beeen the same without him
He used to acting like Jesse Pinkman long before the show!
Ohh the tape should introduce us how jesse  makes a crystal meth
It's science, bitch. Let's cook
BIIIITTTTCCCCHHHH
Lol he forgot the line "break bad" ironic as fuck; hes never gonna forget those words now.
so good
Boy did they get it right with him. His performance the final season was absolutely fantastic
Pulled off forgetting the line super well. Proves that it doesn't have to be perfect as long as you're right for the part
Now this is one hell of an actor
holy hell that was funny
oh cmon it was 2008 there was good cameras what is this potato
Lol this hairstyle makes him look so much older than he actually did in the first season
so good, damn.
He kinda sucks he deff got it for the looks amd u can tell he took alot of classes or something or maybe got into the groove better because he doesnt even sound like pinkman yet
wat?
I LOVE HIM
And the most legendary series started
i couldnt imagine it without him
damn this was so very different from how he performed in the actual scene, he was waaaay into his role at that point lol
This look and voice, without the "yo yo yo Mr. White I'm a wigga" would have been more realistic.
check the hair :)
I just realised... The person acting out Walter's part is Phyllis from The Office. o.o
Jesus Minerals! There Marie
He didn't say bitchhhhh
He wasn't acting. Seemed pretty real to me
To be honest, this was very weak performance, but in the movie, he is solid rock!
He even has the phrase in the tape. “You're just gonna break bad?” 0:52
Oh guy he would have been a perfect Jessy Pinkman...
"If you've gone crazy or depressed, its something I want to know about..."
"I'm awake!"
He had it nailed from the start
HIRED
he was shit
I'm awake XD
Yung jesse
I love you Aaron.
Excellent
sold!
Aaron is so talented and just seems like such a kind person, I love his energy
Nervous, telling eyes, not the best performance, but in bb he was top notch
BITCH
😻🤤
yOOOoo man, hire me.....BITCH!
he has it in him by nature he's tallnted
He's a great actor !
Aaron Paul after he is officially on the show and goes to his mom to surprise her: I GOT THE PART, BITCH
so different compared to how he actually did it. Motivational
Aaron is from Redkneck Idaho.
yeahh audition bitchh
Bitch audition ever 
I mean best audition ever
It's not the audition tape that's impressive. It's that aaron paul was not meant to last past the 1st season, the writers changed their mind!
cut your hair, slacker
Jesssayy
VERY OVERRATED
This is cool thanks for sharing
Just BIT*H at the begining will do the job.
"What?!" "*laugh*" was what got him the job
That was  some good acting -- yo
tool
poor acting
yeah...BITCH.......I got the job...
Jessie’s audition script:





“Ahhhh wire...”
Bitch!
So good, i hope he gets the role.
I wished he said "bitch"
Bitch
Yo
Sick
damn he got fucking great at that role over the series
This boy is really  talented!!!
he's a good kid, is he addict in real life?
so fucking weird lol
He's exactly like 90% of all Hollywood actors, he's unbelievably great on one tv show or movie but never ever good at anything else. Billy Bob Thornton & Mel Gibson both said the Jew own & run Hollywood and they generally only hire other Jews; not always but mostly. I don't really like too many Jew actors/actor comedians. I hate jerry Seinfeld with the passion BUT loved the old tv show. I hate Adam Sandler, Bill Maher and way too many comedic actors to name. I don't give a fuck if they're a Jew or not but Jews just aren't funny people "in general speaking."
and now he will evaporate into obscurity
Notice they made Walter 10 years older in the finished version.
I was waiting for him to say BITCH
I hope he gets the roll
I hope he gets the part!
Aaron Paul is so much like a young Michael Douglas here!
so bad i can act better :s
Did he get the part then?
Why does he look like Steve Harrington
they should have went with tom cruise for this part
No one gives a shit, cape jewelry and pawn

"Age...what...50??"
"I'm 41!"
Actually, he was 50, and Jesse says 60.
I still consider Aaron Paul a Price Is Right contestant
No offence but he looked homeless...
Well, they picked the right guy
He was the ONE! Soul and heart of BB.
Meh, idk. I don't think this guy would make a good Jesse at all, just not seeing it.
watching auditions make me cringe
Back when they intended Walt to be 41, when in reality it was changed to 50.
Fucking beautiful
Watch "Walter White destroying Tuco's Headquarter with piece of fulminated Mercury HD|| 
 https://youtu.be/Dwt8kL4iJUU
They cut it before the sex acts went down why
Yeah bitch..... audition!
Aaron Paul breaking his bad Audition Tape
<3
bitch
https://youtu.be/el9sdzNSYAE
He looks like a young Tom Hiddleston in the thumbnail.
Before he was mega rich and a household name
Did he get the part?
So good!  Too bad his Agents have butchered his career since the show ended.
My favorite actor from Breaking Bad
This guy's not getting the role for sure.
Just get me a role, Yo!.
Tom felton
I just expected a lot of "bitch!" then done
I loved the show but this guy's voice drove me crazy. I hated when he yelled and his S's made my head ache.
Bitches!
Great audition, dude was destined for the role
yeah bitch MAGNETS!
If i didn't know any better this could be turned into a porno
me gustaría ver una versión moderna de volver al futuro con Aaron Paul
He would make a great joker.
Whose watching this in Shuthfuckuptober 3017?
this guy sucks
0:55 wait was Walt really fourty one at the beginning? Cuz that'd mean he lived eleven years with cancer that was supposed to be a pretty bad case too did they change that or something
Is Paul really on meth.? before the audition. I mean, used to or ever addicted to meth? I'm curious. Thanks.
Gatorade me bitch!
Spoiler alert he gets the role
Good job, bitch
Hot boi
Wow this guy is good
admit it! just admit!
Do it now
So glad they gave the Role to Jessie, this Arron Paul guy kinda looks like Jessie but can't act as well....whole show would of been so different with this long haired weirdo.
I'm glad they kept him around!...he was supposed to be killed off at the end of Season 1.
he's so cute, i love him
What's incredible is that Aaron Paul was DEAD BROKE when he did this audition. His parents were helping pay his credit card bills.
How he is 41? LOL
YEAH BITCH! Aaron Paul!
I was totally picturing that scene in my head
Jesse! Jesse! Listen to me!
"Okay Mr. Paul.."
"BITCH"
-GETS PART
The thumbnail looks like a Kool™ cigarette ad 😂🤣
That guy kinda reminds me of Todd from Bojack Horseman
!yo Sydney!
That lady should've gotten the part of Walter White
A great actor and a great human being
I can still hear Todd from Bojack Horseman.
Love It..!!!!! Love Aaron Paul..!!! Yo Bitch!!! lol
This dude couldnt act until season 3
This is amazing,I hope he gets the part to be honest,very well done
"Hired me bitch!"
"You're not getting the part."
samuel drake hello?
Its the "yeah science" guy :D
Anyone else notice that the guy kinda looks like Jesse from Breaking Bad or is it just me?
I want to see the auditions of other people trying for Jesse's role
he looks like Marlon Brando in his youth
i hope he gets the role
Aaron is simply wonderful here! He IS Jesse!
He didn't do well in this audition. Don't know how he got the job, but he did a lot better in the real thing.
Yo yo yo, 148... 3 to the 3 to the 6 to the 9.. representing the ABQ.. what up BIATCH.
no way yo. he was like a dude yo
Auditions... Bitch!
Nice performance. I hope he will get this role.
Why does pink man look like Jack Nicholson and Lars ulrich had a son xD
Anybody else think Aaron kinda looks like Lars ulrich here? ;p
doubt he would get the part
male kristen stewart...
My favorite moment in history 
sup bitches
God, he's brilliant
Jesse was my favorite character!!
That lady was a better actor than Bryan Cranston
is that PEwdiepie?
It's hard to believe 7 years ago was 2010 not 2003
ue mano
He killed it
Impressive how they finished the show before he lost his hair, must have been like running from a giant wave
I m awake ;)
baby boyyy
he's more serious than the real scene
I just read a comment that he was planned to get killed off ,  how can him and Jack both have been planned to die (Yeah I went to LOST real quick ).  I mean you can't have Breaking Bad with just one. I literally don't see where you'd find the story.
He's a blowfish
Man i fucking love this show. Still the best tv show ever made. period.
Bitch
you got the part yo...you nailed  it bitch :D
what's up with that hair??
He never took any acting lessons. Brilliant performance.
"BITCH"
"Welcome to the show"
He did better later in the real scene imo
It's weird cause In the actual episode Jesse says at age 60 and Walt says I'm 50.
That forehead tho.....
looks like it was shot in... 1992
I'd be surprised as fuck if this guy got the role
Gatorade me BITCH!
I wonder if this Bitch got the job.
Walt + Jesse was the actual chemistry.
Fail! This guy has no chance. Next!
I love breaking bad. I binged watched all the season's.  Now they have "Better call Saul" and it's amazingly brilliant.
wait so he got the part without even saying bitch once?
"GATORADE ME, BITCH!"
nice audition bitch
Aaron looks like the younger version of Frank Gallagher from Shameless.
Cow house??
the other's acting is dogshit
He looks like a young Jack Nicholson
You're hired.Bitch!
"ok this is a new type of audition say one word to impress us"
"BITCH"
"fuckkkkkkk hes good"
He's really good. I hope they pick him.
He looks really homeless.
damn, that's some acting
i hope he makes it in.
I hope he gets the part
He definitely ramped his game up 10 notches in the pilot and afterwards, this is fun but looks like he wasn't interested at all!
This guy was good , but i'm glad they went with Michael Cera as Jesse instead
He looks so cutee  ❤
Can we get Cranston's, please?
You can  just see that he's got it.
ahahaha funny how they upscaled all the figures in the pilot! the age, the RV money...
I think I'm glad he got the part, LOL! (... a number of well-deserved Emmy's later…)
10/10
he looks like lars Ulrich !!
He is a handsome dude. he should grow his hair again.
Pretty bad audition
I love this man
Lars Ulrich auditions for Breaking Bad* haha
Better than the original scene. More natural. I guess more inspirational co-character :-)
So when is the show going to be aired bitch?
Yeah, Bitch.
Wow this guy is really good, he should play walt
wow
he's perfect
biaaach!!!!lol
damn this looks so vintage
I presume he may get selected and the show could run for good 5 seasons with him winning the ammy
this kid is pretty good, but Aaron Paul is better..........................
just gonna bread bad!
Wow, nice job. Did he get the part?????
He looks like he's dressed up as Jack Nicholson.
Just got through watching all 5 seasons... What do i do with my life 🙈
YEA MR WHITE....YEAH SCIENCE!!!!!
Anyone who thinks he looks like Tom Felton(Draco Malfoy)
Omg i have an acting audition tomoz for a  drug addict lol. I'm just studying arron pauls Breaking Bad performance xD
Hopefully he gets the part.
Interviewer:- say ' yeah! Science'
Aaron : yeah! Science
Interviewer:- you are in!!
*TRY HARDER NEXT TIME*
Did he ever find out Walt could of saved his girlfriend?
did he get the part?
i hope hes got the role
Because of breaking bad, bitch is now my favorite​ swear word.
is it only me or does he look like hermione from harry potter
Aaron Paul looks like a real life Stewie Griffin
And the bitchathon started her
Interviewer: can you say Bitch?
Paul: BIIIIIIIIITCH
Interviewer: HIRED!
SPOILER ALERT : HE GOT IT
I hope draco malfoy would get the role
Nice actor, but usually young talent like this fades, he probably won't get the cut
Did he get the role?
Damn he's good, even when there was no effort on the other end.
Aaron: "Bitch"

The entire production crew: "You got the part."
So I guess they told him to be black and that's how he got the part lmao
Omfg dude
His eyes nailed it for him
His hair in here makes him look even more like a bad guy
.....And a legend was born 🎉
fodaa
hell ya bitch capn' cook
So much hair, wow.  It's kind of disorienting to see at first, somehow.  Suddenly spotting The Rock with **pig tails**... it's kinda like how THAT would be, 

I'm curious, because I can't really tell... was the head shake/ stand up/ "Sorry!" at the end also part of the script read-through, or was he actually **apologizing** for some dialogue mistake?

It seemed totally disjointed, like he genuinely became frustrated with something and stopped reading to react to it.
he looks like Jack Nicholson
from watching this i realized The way that people act and talk for the camera is completely different to how people talk or act in real life
So Did He Get It?
What?Brilliant haha
I like him better without the hair
bitch
that hair
i hop he git de rul
Não poderia ser outro ator!
Aaron Paul ficou perfeito como Jesse Pinkman
Alias, muitas saudades dessa série, mesmo assistindo várias vezes, dá aquela pontinha de dor e amor no coração.
Amo demais esse elenco ♥
he acts a lot better in breaking bad then in this
Aaron's a brilliant actor. :)
So cool for being able to watch this 👌🏻
yo bitch
he looks like jack nicholson from cucko's nest xD
3 Emmys later BITCH!!!
Got the Role, BITCH!
Aaron paul hey? now lets watch the jesse kid's audition tape.
it's the "YO BITCH" thing that did it for Aaron Paul.
yeah science!
Anyone else think he would make a great Eddie Dean?
he really looked like a meth head here tho
I cri every time
Seriously...his body language and facial expressions, even just sitting there. Dude is unreal.
right on bitch!
Really good casting.
Give me this job, BITCH
spoiler: he dosent get da role
I sense the force of Jack Nicholson & Trevor Philips [gtav]
Video tape bitch

Son of a Minister Ya Bitch Love ya Bitch 😉
and just like that, the start to an amazing show
He did fantastic in his interview
The guy is good tbh & I hope they get Chuck Norris for the dea officer
This is bad azz!
YEAH BITCH!!!
His audition wasn't amazing but his acting in the show was
just say one word " BItch "
Did he end up getting it??
DAAMN DAT HAIR
Jesse was originally meant to die in season 1, meaning he was actually auditioning for a comparatively small roll compared to the brilliance the Jesse turned into. Or at least that is what I heard on a 10-facts-about-BB video.
he's so cute
2016 bitch!
she said that Walt was 41!!!!! not 50
she said that Walt was 41!!!!! not 50
awesome auction bitch
So Walter White was a 41 year old woman
amazing actor
That was good.
MONKOPHILE....HAHAHAHAHA....THX....
BITCH <3
I find it funny that Aaron Paul looks like one of the guys who shot up columbine
I hope he gets the job
age 50? 41? Its 60 - 50. What this bitch talking about ? she should lose her job for forgetting
Good one!  Super star in the making.
I guess all the other actors that came for Jessie's catacther were fucking horrible if they picked this guy there is absolutely nothing special in this audition
his voice sounds different
God ahead make my day
i think they should hire Malcom in the Middle to play Jesse
I dont know why i got nervous for him to do it right...i mean he already got the role :D
wow hes good they should have used him as the part
i remember he was on van wilder
awesome!!!    bitch
Blue Meth. Bitch.
I seriously think acting is down to luck. Obviously he is better than me but hes playing main role on biggest tv show on earth. How shitty is the competition? I mean jesus christ i should probabyl stop wasting my time and could have at least got a support role. Im just not impressed
he's got brown eyes?!?!
wow that was awesome. I hope he gets the part
Who's watching in 2016
June 2016 and I'm still watching this.
How does anyone perform when the person reading Walt's lines is putting nothing into it. Must be hard to get into character that way.
dude was so nervous haha glad he got the part. cant imagine a better actor for the role
Honestly he wasn't that good. But in breaking bad he's Awsome
Whatafuck desculpa do To pewds?!!?? ;-;
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH PEWDS!
my bbyy
it would be tough auditioning when the person playing walter is minnie mouse
Can someone tell me why did they laughed in the last part of the vid? Non english speaker here
Audition...BITCH..!!
really wanna see some other jesse pink man auditions to see what it would be like if someone else played him
Couldn't imagine anyone else playing Jesse.
nah I don't think they will use this guy for the part.
Well did he get the part?
He just does it. Like its a no brainer for him. It's just a switch that subconsciously flips in his head. I love it. Bitch.
This guys pretty good, hope he gets the role.
How could this methhead ever play the role of TV sitcom methhead. I don't get it.
Shoulda filmed him saying BITCH.
Note that Walter White was supposed to be 41!!!   They changed it to 50 when Bryan Cranston took the role
Great Job Aaron, hope he gets the part
Can someone link me this scene
But why the fuk is this trending now?

not complaining but ...why??
I hope he get's the role
Interviewer:"say Science".
Aaron:"Science BITCH!".
Interviewer:"Your'e in".
Holy shit, man, I forgot how potato quality 2008 YouTube-worthy cameras were. Like... fuck, dude.
I thought it was pewdiepie on the thumbnail hahahha
Yo.......Bitch!!!
That hair.
He needs to play Venom ( Eddie Brock )
WHERE IS MY MONEY,BITCH?!?!
holy shit!!! 6 million views!?! you gotta be kidding!!
You're hired, kid.
i find it hilarious he forgot his lines and he was so good he still got the part
I love when people call Jesse over emotional or whiny and fail to realize how much shit he's gone through. Would you say the same shit to war vets on the street? PTSD is a very real thing...
This part was literally made for him lol he's perf
>tfw he looked like an actual drug user
I love you Jesse Pinkman and I will always fucking do even if you truly PISSED ME OFF so much on the final season of Breaking Bad.
<3
I hope he gets the role. He is really good!
You fucking awesome mother fukers!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I thought this audition was kind of mediocre. But the look he had, was very likely what Vince Gilligan was shooting for.
"I'm awake!" "....what!?" Lmao
Cruising downhill through season 4 on my 4th re-watch of BB. Every time I watch it, I spot something else, some other subtle nuance or cross-reference that just makes me gasp at the sheer BRILLIANCE of this story. I'm a sucker for HBO serials -  seen most of 'em - but for my money, there's nothing holds a candle to BB. An
I dont think a show like this will ever happen again.  Aaron was amazing. Such a powerful innocence to his character. Played perfectly.
0:53 "roll credits" **ding**
press 6
 repeatedly haha
Paul was excellent as Jesse but this audition was terrible compared to the aired scene.
yeah bitch
He looks so different with hair like that
this is pewdiepie!!!
he's really good. i hope he makes it!
Apparently he never had ANY acting classes or professional instruction in the art… Natural talent!
Dat hair
So originally Walter was supposed to be 41?
anyone realize that walter is 40s here but in the show he is in his 50s
not enough bitch
First off his forehead is absolutely colossal‼️😂 secondly he looks like The biggest Laker fan of all time😂😂 and last Gustavo was the shit man💯 I'm still on season 4 on Netflix 😳
Excellent decision, casting director(s).
he is the perfect Jesse.. can't imagine the show without him.. and him and Walter has just the best chemistry ever.. it's just while you're watching you feel that they are connected emotionally that they can't be separated together..even at the end i still console myself that Jesse forgave Mr. White...
whos still watching this in December, 2015???? :)
He did fine, nothing to be embarrassed about there...
Picked the best man for the job
This song makes feel im strong and im believer thank you rachel your very inspiring ☺️☺️

Totalmente Demais...que sdd
I've heard this song many times before, but I've never "listened" to it, until now. I'm a cancer survivor and this song just literally moved me to tears. I'm still nowhere near 100%, but I'll get there, because I have a lot of fight left in me and I'm cancer free.
The first time I ever saw this young lady Rachel Platten was on today's show on American Idol. You have such a kind warm spirit within you and you showed it when u gave the young lady advice for her singing and pin pointed it toward what the judges were looking for, you said it with so much passion, so much positivity and love and care from your spirit within you. Your words you said to her touched the hearts of everyone listening. I was dying crying with how u said your words. Anyone would be blessed to have you in their life. You are  truly a lovely inspiration. I wish I knew you personally. I know your parents are very pleased with you. Bless you sweetheart. There arent many like you! PS and you are very intelligent!
música da banda:)

Right song
This is my fight song This Is My Life song Take Back My
Like a wrecking ball
this is my  💜 love song
wawwwwwww
Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)
And it's been two years I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

A lot of fight left in me

Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Know I've still got a lot of fight left in me

"This is my favourite song" LOL <3 '
When I hear this song I think about how a girl in my 3rd grade class was trying to seperate me and my bff. She would do anything she could to get us apart. And her friend said to my friend "You're supposed to be white, not chinese if your adoptive mom is white!'. And this girl and her friend also pulled us apart and one told me my friend doesn't want to have playdates anymore, and the other told my friend that I don't want to have playdates with her anymore. She did many more things, this is just the start.There are so many things I could've said to her, but this song helped me build up the courage to tell the teacher, and they got in big trouble. They deserved it though. 1 like=1 word I didn't say said.

This is my fart song take back my fart song my but ahs turned on starting now I'll fart strong
I made a YouTube vivo of this please watch
This is my. FAvori
love this song
I hadn’t really heard this song in its entirety until earlier today. I caught the recent duet on American Idol, which prompted me to purchase the song and come and watch the video. I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. Last fall, my mother almost died from multiple pulmonary embolisms in her lungs and a massive thrombosis in her leg. Last month, my 16-year-old daughter was diagnosed with Stage 2A Bulky Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. I feel as though this song should become my new personal theme song. In our house, we are survivors. We continue to fight every day. For those struggling through difficult times, keep fighting the good fight. Lots of love to you all. ❤️
2018 My favourite song👌
That is really cool
I love your song it's my favorite song
I listen to this song before every #meeting.

I was at the lowest point in my life when this song came out. I lost many friends due to my mental health, I was about to move out of state for grad school, I started a brand new job, and my support systems were crumbling. My mom and I heard this on our way into work one day. She looked at me, and she said, “You will fight, you will beat this. This is your anthem. I love you.” Since then, I’ve been so grateful and supporting Rachel Platten in every way I can. Thank you Rachel.
Very nice👏👏👏
love this song 😍

I could not love this song more! I love what it represents and what it can do for people <3 If I could write a Rx of this song for people I would hand thos prescriptions out like candy!!! One of the most relatable songs I believe the world has ever had! We all need a fight song at some time, it should be full of energy and emotion, it should help us be a better person, stronger and feeling right inside!!!!
Pll
